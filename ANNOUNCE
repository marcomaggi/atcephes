		  Cephes functions under GNU Autotools
		  ====================================


Cephes  is a  collection  of mathematical  routines  for scientific  and
engineering applications.   This package  installs a C  language library
collecting the Cephes functions for the type "double".

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux system.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:

		 <http://github.com/marcomaggi/cephes/>

the documentation of Cephes is available online:

Notes for revision 0.1d0
------------------------

* Most likely some adjustments are needed.

* The  directory  "scheme"  contains  a table  of  functions  in  Scheme
  symbolic expression form and a  demo program that automatically builds
  a Vicare Scheme binding for Cephes.   It should be easily adaptable to
  other Scheme implementations.
