1. Introduction
---------------

Cephes  is a  collection  of mathematical  routines  for scientific  and
engineering applications.   This package  installs a C  language library
collecting the Cephes functions for the type "double".

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux system.


2. License
----------

Some software in this archive may be from the book _Methods and Programs
for  Mathematical   Functions_  (Prentice-Hall   or  Simon   &  Schuster
International,  1989)  or  from   the  Cephes  Mathematical  Library,  a
commercial product.  In either event,  it is copyrighted by  the author.
What you  see here may be  used freely but  it comes with no  support or

  The two  known misprints in the  book are repaired here  in the source
listings for the gamma function and the incomplete beta integral.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd cephes-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd cephes
    $ sh autogen.sh

we  should   now  see   the  executable   "configure"  script   and  the
"Makefile.in" file.  From now on everything  is the same as for building
from a proper release tarball, but we have to run the "configure" script
enabling the maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/cephes

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/cephes

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

D. Importing notes
------------------

Notes about how the original code has been imported in this package.

* The  functions  in  the  module  "cmath"  expect  "isfinite()"  to  be
  defined.  The original does not have an implementation for it, but the
  C99 standard defines a macro.  So a custom module:

     src/custom/isfinite.c

  has been added implementing  a function "cephes_custom_isfinite()" and
  the following lines have been added to the "mconf.h" files:

     extern int cephes_custom_isfinite (double x);
     #define isfinite cephes_custom_isfinite
